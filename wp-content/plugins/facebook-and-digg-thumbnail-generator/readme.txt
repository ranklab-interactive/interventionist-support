== Description ==
This plugin will automatically add meta tags on the HEAD section of a post, which will then be used by Facebook, Digg, and other website as the preview images of the link you are sharing. It will also enhance your wall posts by adding a clickable videos embed for youtube and Vimeo on the left-side of your Facebook  walls. <a href = 'http://www.facebook.com/pages/FedmichMovies/259185582821'>Sample 1</a> , <a href = 'http://www.facebook.com/pages/FedmichLyrics/118633791513828'>Sample 2</a>.
It doesn't require other plugin and it can be used as is. Just activate it and you can proceed to sharing the urls of your posts to facebook.
Some technical details:
Unlike some other plugins, this one doesn't create additional table on your database. The plugin uses regular expressions and I've added some logics to ensure fast execution of the functions used. It uses cache and custom fields for processing some posts.
Previously knowned as "Facebook and Digg Thumbnail generator" plugin.

== Installation ==
Just activate the plugin and paste the url of post into your facebook pages.
To test if theres a picture being generated, paste it via Facebook's debugger/lint tool.
